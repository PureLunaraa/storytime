Iqih: "Aughh today’s been rough... Kev pull up real quick, I need some hydration from your SP1-RM 💦 I'm about to go deeper than K4kkarot’s power level 😩💀"  
Kev: "Keep it consistent, go faster. Don’t stop 😁"  

# 3 years later...
Iqih: "Pls... can I stop now? It’s been 3 years. My lips look like G3del’s burnt P-N toaster incident 😔 I’ve been going up and down like a Roblox obby loop... Master pls 🥺👉👈"  
G3del: "M1key don’t bring up my P-N mishap or I’ll get angry. Matter of fact, let me tag in 😈"  
Iqih: "NOOOO it’s too much, I can’t— cough cough 😭"  
K4kkarot: "Sup, I'm here now too 😎💀"  

# Poor Iqih’s throat experienced full system failure 🕊️

Kev: "Alright hold up, I’m calling the squad 😎"  
# 10 tall, mysterious shadowy figures approach with b-buffed stats with swords sticking outta their pants 💀  

K4kkarot & the boys: "Iqih, kneel now, lil sussy boy with long swords sticking outta their pants 💢👀"  
Iqih: "Why does this feel like naval missile launchers are being spammed in my mouth 😭 my internal system already broke..."  
# He's now rounder than a Roblox R6 head from taking too many... inputs 😔

🎤 Interview Time:

Interviewer: "Hey lil buddy, can you summarize your life?"  
Iqih: "It all started on a rough day... I needed a ‘snack’ from Kev but then he went full Ultra Instinct. Then G3del joined, and suddenly there were two... tools... in my system. THEN K4kkarot showed up. Now I’m getting combo’d like it’s Smash Bros and my HP bar disappeared 😭 Kev even called the final boss squad and I got clapped by a full 10-man PvP team. I’m just a support class..."  

Interviewer: "LMAO ratio'd you little sidekick 🤣"  

Iqih: "s1tfu unsuccessful ragebait 😤"  

# Iqih’s internals couldn’t handle the pressure... Rest in pixels 🕊️🪦
